            <h2>Cultural Blog: My Thinking Style</h2>
            <p id="date">March 15, 2015</p>
            <p>
              My thinking style is Concrete Random. I deal with the obvious and don't look for hidden meanings. For me, what is around me is what I use. I don't like to think about what happened in the past or what is going to happen in the future. For me, It's best to focus on the task at hand and think about how to make it through. If I start dwelling on other factors beyond my control, I get distracted. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My information processing style is random. I don't have to go in order to understand things. As a matter of fact, I just need a chunk of information and I can build off of that. Even when following instructions on how to build something, once I see a general sense of how it goes, I usually complete it on my own. In life, I don't like to plan things out and too much planning takes away the enjoyment of the moment. I prefer to figure it out as I go along. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to experiment when finding out the right way to do something. I never ask for directions and have a hard time asking for help. But, I think it's because I enjoy the challenge of figuring it out on my own. I like to feel my way through situations with my intuition and don't like to follow rules or signs. Though I enjoy listening to others and hearing the way they work, I prefer to solve my problems independently. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My learning style is that I like to experiment, and see things not working as a part of the process of figuring out a problem. I don't really get frustrated when something doesn't work out because I know eventually I'll get it. I don't mind a little competition because winning, for me, doesn't have anything to do with anyone else. I am only competing with myself. If given a choice to solve a problem with a group or by myself, I would choose to do it on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't like to have restrictions or boundaries of what I can and can't do. I guess that means I like to make my own rules, though I don't have a problem following formulas. Normal routines bore me, so I constantly push myself to keep myself entertained. Once something is done, I have no interest in doing it again. That's like looking back, and I'm not that big on living in the past. Though I am organized, I don't keep detailed records unless I have to (taxes, etc.). I tend to keep things like passwords in my head, which comes back to bite me more often than not. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I think one of the things I should learn to do is to learn how to ask for help from others. I'm also thinking to plan things more in the near future.
