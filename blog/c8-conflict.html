            <h2>Cultural Blog: Conflict</h2>
            <p id="date">April 19, 2015</p>
              <p>
                I think one of my biggest conflicts came from a landlord I had - or am about to have because we are moving in a few weeks. She has no idea how to keep things clean, and because of this, the common areas in the place we live are a mess. I have tried countless times to gently suggest changes that could be made. My husband has even attempted at cleaning these areas himself, but no matter what we do, the dirt always comes back.
              </p>
              <p>
                It got to a point when every time I walked in the door, I got upset. I felt the dirty energy that she was putting out there. I felt like she wasn't respecting the place where we all lived, and in turn, I started to take it very personally. When I thought or talked about her, I would get furious.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thing is, I love my neighborhood and the place we live in could be great if only she would take care of it. The frustration level was getting to be out of hand because I could not get her to change her ways. I went from angry to sad to just plain fed up!
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I knew that if I wanted a place to be exactly as I wanted it, it would have to be my own place. I talked about this with my husband and we put together a plan to buy our own house. Though it's a bit in the future, I know that it will become a reality and then, finally, we can have a surrounding that fits into the way we truly want to live.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I could go back, I'm not sure there is anything I could have done differently. I recently saw inside the place where she lives to discover that she lived in a mess as well. She may have some personal problem that I am not aware of.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps I could have tried to cure her of her habits, or perhaps I should have been more direct and say: "Look, this place is getting out of hand. Let me help you fix it." If she said no, we cold have moved out earlier but at least did everything in our power to make it better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, by getting at the heart of the conflict, I was able to figure out that the source of my frustration was not having a place of my own. This is about to change!
              </p>
