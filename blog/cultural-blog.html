            <h2>My First Cultural Blog: Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>

                Based on the video, I think Dev bootcamp is different from other bootcamps out there. It seems more like a culture. A way of thinking. A kind of mix of programming and the humans behind it. I feel that every part of my being is about to be submerged into this culture, and I think the tools and people that will guide me are passionate about their methods of teaching.

                I see myself stuyding incredibly hard on my own, but at the same time, collaborating with people who are at the same crossroads in their lives. We all ended up at this point in our history, and I look forward to sharing all of the blood, sweat and tears with them.

                I don't think that my expectations have changed. Going in, I wanted to know as much as I could about coding and what it would take to be a developer. I still have those same expectations, but now I think, if anything has changed, I expect to meet people here that I will share a common bond with throughout my new journey.

                This kind of learning environment is thrilling. Usually, one just sits and listens. This type of environment though seems stimulating and will keep my brain awake to new knowledge each step of the way. I like the combination of individual work, socializing, web meetings, and of course, in person participation.

                I am nervous but I am more excited than nervous. As far as what came up, I keep seeing the road ahead of me getting longer and longer, but that's not because of the time or effort, but because of the immense amount of information there is to learn. It's fascinating to me how much is out there and I can't wait to walk down this path with all my classmates and instructors.
